Flexible Version Control
========================

Reversion is an extension to the Django web framework that provides
comprehensive version control facilities.

Features:

    * Roll back to any point in a model's history - an unlimited undo facility!
  
    * Recover deleted models - never lose data again!
  
    * Admin integration for maximum usability.
  
    * Group related changes into revisions that can be rolled back in a single
      transaction.
    
    * Automatically save a new version whenever your model changes using
      Django's flexible signalling framework.

    * Automate your revision management with easy-to-use middleware.

Reversion can be easily added to your existing Django project with an absolute
minimum of code changes.
